## Project Overview
This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program and focuses on understanding how client requests and responses work in web development. The primary goal is to learn how browsers send requests to servers via different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, and others. Additionally, this project covers the concepts of URLs and URIs, and how they are used in web communication.

## Learning Objectives
* What a URL is
* What HTTP is
* How to read a URL
* The scheme for a HTTP URL
* What a domain name is
* What a sub-domain is
* How to define a port number in a URL
* What a query string is
* What an HTTP request is
* What an HTTP response is
* What HTTP headers are
* What the HTTP message body is
* What an HTTP request method is
* What an HTTP response status code is
* What an HTTP Cookie is
* How to make a request with cURL
* What happens when you type google.com in your browser (Application level)

## Tools and Technologies
* curl: A command-line tool for transferring data using various protocols. It's commonly used to send HTTP requests and receive responses.
* telnet: A command-line tool used for manual communication with servers. It helps in understanding the raw format of HTTP requests and responses.
* Python (Optional): For scripting and automating HTTP requests and responses.
* Bash: For writing shell scripts to handle HTTP communication.

## Getting Started
1. Prerequisites:

Basic understanding of web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Familiarity with the command line.
Basic knowledge of programming (Python or Bash).

2. Setup:

Install curl on your machine (if not already installed).
Ensure telnet is available on your system.
(Optional) Set up a Python environment if you plan to write Python scripts.

3. Resources:
