## 0x10. Python - Network #1
## ALX: Python, Scripting, Backend, API

## Project Overview
This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program and focuses on understanding how client requests and responses work in web development. The primary goal is to learn how browsers send requests to servers via different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, and others. Additionally, this project covers the concepts of URLs and URIs, and how they are used in web communication.

## Learning Objectives
* How to fetch internet resources with the Python package urllib
* How to decode urllib body response
* How to use the Python package requests #requestsiswaysimplerthanurllib
* How to make HTTP GET request
* How to make HTTP POST/PUT/etc. request
* How to fetch JSON resources
* How to manipulate data from an external service

## Tools and Technologies
* urllib.request python module
* telnet: A command-line tool used for manual communication with servers. It helps in understanding the raw format of HTTP requests and responses.
* Python (Optional): For scripting and automating HTTP requests and responses.
* Bash: For writing shell scripts to handle HTTP communication.

## Getting Started
1. Prerequisites:

Basic understanding of web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Familiarity with the command line.
Basic knowledge of programming (Python or Bash).

2. Setup:

Install curl on your machine (if not already installed).
Ensure telnet is available on your system.
(Optional) Set up a Python environment if you plan to write Python scripts.

3. Resources:

[curl Documentation]()
[HTTP Overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)
RFC 3986: URI Generic Syntax
